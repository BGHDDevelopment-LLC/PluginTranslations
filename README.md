Anyone can contribute by adding new languages or modifying existing ones.

**Please do not edit the Default Files folder.**

## Inspiration
The idea for this type of system came when I was looking over TechCode's translation system.
You may find their system on this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TechsCode-Team/PluginTranslations).
